# Advanced Day Manager (ADM)

*Advanced Day Manager* (ADM) is a feature-packed, open-source task management and scheduling application designed to help
you streamline your day. ADM combines robust task management with automated scheduling capabilities, enabling you to
prioritize tasks, track progress, and generate a structured daily plan—all in one place.

## Key Features

- **Flexible Task Management:**  
  Create tasks with rich attributes like descriptions, due dates, priorities, categories, estimates, and resources.
  Quickly mark tasks as completed or important, and easily organize them into lists and categories.

- **Subtasks & Recurring Tasks:**  
  Break down large tasks into subtasks and let ADM handle recurring tasks automatically. It can reopen recurring tasks
  on a set schedule so you never lose track of ongoing responsibilities.

- **Automated Scheduling (Coming Soon):**  
  Generate a daily schedule based on your tasks, their priorities, time estimates, and flexibility. ADM will suggest an
  optimal daily plan, showing you how much time you’ll spend on various tasks and providing insights into your workload
  distribution.

- **Calendar & History Views:**  
  Visualize tasks on a calendar for a quick overview of deadlines and due dates. Review completed tasks in the history
  section and restore them if needed.

- **Integrated Productivity Tools:**  
  Track your effort using count and time-based progress bars, manage task-related resources, and maintain notes within
  the app.

- **Customizable Sorting & Filtering:**  
  Sort tasks by priority, queue, stack, or filter by categories and keywords. Multi-selection mode allows bulk
  operations like mass deletion or moving tasks across lists.

## Themes (Coming Soon)

Personalize with custom CSS themes. This feature will allow you to choose or create your own themes
to match your aesthetic preferences. A dedicated setup will enable easy theme installation and switching for both
Windows and Linux users.
